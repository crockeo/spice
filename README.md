# spice

*spice* is my attempt at writing a semi-useful (not only to me, but to the
ecosystem as a whole) library. It attempts to address the fact that there are
very, very few game engines or frameworks existent for Haskell. *spice* uses
[Elerea](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/elerea) for its FRP library,
[GLFW](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/GLFW) for its OpenGL context, and
[OpenGL](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/OpenGL) for its rendering. All of
these come together to provide a framework for programmers to write their own
videogames in Haskell.

# Installation

No final installation instructions will be given until the library gets going.
So long as you can install Elerea, GLFW, and OpenGL, you should be able to use
it and work on it.
